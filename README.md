## What is this?

This is a simple, offline tool built with Flutter for Desktop. It takes a text prompt describing a UI and uses an AI model (via an API key you provide) to generate the Flutter code for it. It's a great way to quickly scaffold basic UI components without writing everything from scratch.

## Features (in this version)

*   ü§ñ **AI Code Generation:** Generate basic Flutter UI code from a prompt.
*   üíæ **Local Projects:** All your projects are saved locally on your machine.
*   üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Run & Build:** Instantly see your generated code in action.
*   **(LIMITED)** Supabase Integration: Manually connect to your Supabase project by providing your keys.

## Installation & Setup 

You need to have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine.




**Step 1: Clone the Repo**


```git clone https://github.com/AbdulAlim-01/Crazzy.git ```

**Step 2: Get Dependencies**

Navigate into the project directory and run:

    cd Crazzy
    flutter pub get

**Step 3: Run the App**

Make sure you have a Windows/Mac/Linux desktop device selected  and run:

    flutter run -d windows

(Replace windows with macos or linux if you're on a different` OS.)

**Step 4: Add Your AI API Key**

The first time you run the app, it will ask for your Gemini API key. You'll need to get this from Google AI Studio. The app will store it locally for you.
That's it! Now you can start building.
